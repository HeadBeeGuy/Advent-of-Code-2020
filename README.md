# Advent of Code 2020

This repository is for my solutions for Advent of Code 2020.

This will be my third year, but I generally get to about the halfway point when the increasing difficulty and holiday schedule tend to push it off my desk. My naive hope is to complete the event this year and get all 50 stars, but I'll see if that's feasible or not!

This year I'll try and do everything in Rust. I'm not especially good at it, and I only ever end up using it for Advent of Code, but I like using it anyway. I've learned a lot of neat language features through Advent of Code and I find that it helps me learn concepts and tools that are useful when I'm working in other languages as well.

I find that Rust is so extremely efficient that even my silly, unoptimized solutions run extremely quickly. I try to go for comprehensibility over raw performance, or at least that's what I tell myself!

For Christmas!
